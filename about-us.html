          Health is the wholeness and integrity of living systems. In a time
          where humans are taking away the goodness of nature, we strive to turn
          the wheel full circle by preserving it. Our philosophy is based on the
          principles of health, ecology, fairness, and care. We are making an
          effort towards a sustainable agro-ecosystem that ensures soil & water
          conservation and reduced pollution. Organic is not just a healthy way
          of eating but also one which is guilt free. When we take care of the
          earth, it takes care of us too. Founded on the belief that nature need
          not lose out in our quest for advancement, Organic Tattva strives to
          support a wholesome life print. We do our bit for Mother Nature. And
          by making just one right change in life, so can everyone else. We can
          change the course of the things to come. Come to be part of the
          Organic Tattva story.

            <h4>THE FARMS</h4>
            <p>
              Our farmers are carefully chosen and trained to work towards
              practicing environment-friendly farming techniques. From the
              chemical-free soil to the grains being hand-picked everything you
              see is organically farmed to give you the highest quality product.
              We check the soil quality, cropping pattern, prevalent crop
              rotation and the nutrient levels in the soil. While doing this, we
              ensure that the chosen region has suitable weather and temperature
              conditions. We follow a series of practices like soil fertility
              management, seed collection, biodiversity, composting, water
              management, crop rotation and protection which are extremely
              efficient and regenerative in nature.

              With a combination of traditional and state-of-the-art machinery,
              we have an effective yet efficient way of functioning. All
              products are stored in a hygienic and C02 fumigated environment
              for infestation control. Our advanced practices and dehydration
              technologies ensure that all our products retain their maximum
              level of potency. Our products are dehydrated in a dry, sterile
              environment to prevent the chances of a phytochemical breakdown.
              We have a specialized mechanism to preserve the matrix of
              bio-active molecules possessed by all the products by grinding
              them at low temperatures. What we provide you as final products
              are of the highest quality, pure and natural.

              You can enjoy food that is hygienically packed and retains all the

              always been supportive of food that is more tasty, nutritious and
              holistic. Having seen the highest numbers when it comes to
              customers talking about the benefit of shifting to a more organic
